This is a small C# library and some tests which allow the genetic optimization of BNF grammars (Grammatical Evolution) via the NSGA2 algorithm. This allows the optimization to take place over multiple objectives.
For a complete example, have a look at the PopulationTest1 and PopulationTest2 unit tests. These set up a grammar and optimization run.
